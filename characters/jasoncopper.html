<h1>Jason Copper</h1>
<div class="longtext">
    <p>The village of <b>Wheatlock</b> is full of hard-working people. Not intelligent, or ambitious, or even creative people… But hard-working for sure. Jason was born in this little village and spent his early years scavenging for books and knowledge. His family, as everybody from the village, were wheat farmers. It was a monotonous and difficult job and much too boring for Jason.
    So he left…
    When he turned 16 he left without a word. Of course, he felt a little remorse, leaving his parents (Frederick and Joanna) and younger brother, Thomas, behind but… What else was there for him to do? He read every book, from fairy tales to agricultural studies he could find, borrowing from anybody. The few wandering merchants had the most interesting once. Once which talked about mechanical guns, and acid made from household items. Compounds which, upon smearing on even an ordinary stone would make it glow. Even before 16 Jason was able to build few of these, even the once which required magical affinity.

    Magic… That was unheard and unwanted in Wheatlock. So were the enchantments and contraptions of the future.

    Jason left and wandered all over the world, however, not for too long. Barely a year later he heard of the Engineering branch of the Izzet League. He applied and spent 2 years as an attendant, studying magical, alchemical, and technological engineering. He learned so much in those two years it was hard to believe. There was so much to the world he would have never known if he stayed in Wheatlock. Too much… And they let him learn to little at a time. The really amazing stuff they constantly kept him away from. But he needed more…
    In the village he learned that life is dull and monotonous and physical prowess can overcome anything. He was not strong, however. He was quick, but not strong. In the one year spent on the road he met a few ill-willing humans and creatures. He learned, then, that life was mostly superfluous. Sentient life that is, pure waste of potential. Those who counted, who did something and deserved to exist and thrive… oh there were so few of them. Life was wasted on the lowly masses. He learned, thus, that if somebody wasted his time or god-forgive stood in his way, he had the right to move them. To bury them… He had to kill, shortly after leaving the village. But it wasn’t that scary and life-changing as in the stories.
    It was but a moment in his life.
    These sentiments only grew in him as he listened to the old and boring instructors and waited for the other attendees to replicate a simple enchantment. Those absolute mongrels… Only one other attendee elicited any positive reaction from Jason. Admiration? Respect? Love, perhaps? He interested him, at the very least. His name was Zhao Hannoi an elf with the unnaturally beautiful features of his kind. He was smart and quick. He seemed to be kind but the same way, Jason realized, as he was. Kind when it was beneficial… And that made him dangerous. They never really talked, but their rivalry was palpable.
    What happened thus, when Jason was 19, was in some form expected.
    Jason decided to leave. His gain of theoretical knowledge stagnated and the practical stuff they learned and showed them was quickly too boring. How could using an artifact on a straw doll or even on a rabbit provide real results? At any rate, the ‘mad’ in ‘mad scientist’ people often used to describe the Izzet Engineers was rather lacking. The facility had many advanced artifacts stores here and there, all under too tight a watch. There were, however, blueprints which were less guarded. Jason had his eyes on one of them:
    It was a theoretical designed, never actually built. It consisted of three parts:
    One was a magico-mechanic bodysuit, a highly technological armor which was needed to construct the other two both as help and a protection. The second was a floating contraption borrowing on the supposed designs of the floating cities of the past. It was given to be roughly the size of a house and its layout and construction made it a perfect enhanced laboratory for the quick and self-dependent (It could supposedly recycle the byproducts of its own chemical and mechanical processes to create additional energy thus requiring extremely little outside input) construction of the third design: an intricate automaton. Automatons of the basic variety were conceivable, even buildable, however this one differed. It, supposedly, possessed real intelligence, real consciousness. This raised an interesting point especially together with the floating laboratory, which was scribbled on the side of the blueprint as well
    One of these could build an army of automatons by itself!!
    In theory, at least. The construction of these things would require more resource than the Izzet could spare a big space and time. And even then the design might not work. It was beckoning of something extraordinary and yet, just harmless enough not to be too closely guarded…
    Jason stole this blueprint; it was rather easy. Nobody expected him to do such a thing. However, somebody else had the same idea. He saw the figure moving alongside him in the shadows and hiding behind pleasant social lies while slipping deeper into the laboratories but he never expected him to go after the same thing. He should have known… Zhao and him reached the blueprint almost at the same time. Jason snatched up the paper but Zhao wanted it too. They struggled. They might have been too loud. Somebody heard them. They parted hastily and fled. It was hours later when Jason could calmly survey the blueprint. In the struggle the paper tore; he had the half with the design of the magico-mechanic armor and half of the floating laboratory. Zhao must have the other half of it and the design of the automaton. Ah… Out of the three that was what really interested Jason. Never mind that now, he had to leave. He packed up his contraptions, a generous amount of copper, other metals and alchemical components he managed to amass and left.
    Since then Jason travels the roads trying to acquire the money and the resources to begin building the magico-mechanical armor. He is so close. He often props up his makeshift shop at a smaller town or village and sell some minor artifacts. It’s a scam really. There are a few things he could make easily, but their novelty can bring in a pretty penny. For example: he can apply a mixture of a specific powder and plain vinegar on a small item and after it sits for 2 hours, it would, on touch emit light. Very basic… Jason would put this enchanted item (a simple stone, most of the time) in a metal tube with a small glass attached to one end. Touching a designated whole on the tube, and thus the enchanted stone light would come out of the tube. He calls it the Tubelight (Fénycső). He can in the same fashion encode an illusion of a beautiful scenery in a basic wood-carved figure. He could encode an auditory effect as well, for example a famous quote from a book or something like that. The most profitable item of his, however, is an item imbued with olfactory effects. Imbuing an iron rose with actual, strong rose smell. That is a fan favorite.
    Most of the time he has 4 items on sale. He cannot make more at a time. If he tires, the one he made first would lose its effect. 4 is enough to cover food and travel costs though. This also means that when he arrives to a different place and creates the 4 items the owners of the previous once lose their product. That’s okay. They are not meant to last forever. They are well informed about this.
    Now 20 years old Jason wants to do something big. Something that would amass money. He is not getting close to his goal. Maybe he should find companions?... Not idiots though. But somebody to earn money with. Or somebody to try his artifacts on?... Same thing really.
    An oddities vendor named Yepos Goldlock has a job for anybody who wants to help. Perhaps Jason could check out what artifacts Yepos has. And there is a festival in that same city. Should be an easy few pieces of gold…</p>
